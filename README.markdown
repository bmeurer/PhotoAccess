## About

With [PhotoAccess](http://benediktmeurer.de/PhotoAccess) you can easily transfer photos directly from your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch to any computer using a web browser over WiFi. Select an existing photo or take a new picture, and PhotoAccess will display a download URL below the photo. Enter that URL in a web browser on any computer on the same network and you can download the full resolution photo, rotated to the correct orientation. The perfect solution to transfer just that one photo which you need right now.
